Project Title: Building a Blogging Platform

Project Description:
Create a simple yet functional blogging platform where users can view, create, edit, and delete blog posts. This project will involve building a frontend using React and leveraging Next.js for server-side rendering and routing. Users will be able to:

View Blog Posts: Visitors should be able to browse existing blog posts.
Create New Posts: Authenticated users can create new blog posts.
Edit and Delete Posts: Authors can edit or delete their own posts.
Authentication: Implement a basic authentication system to differentiate between regular visitors and authors.
Responsive Design: Ensure the application is responsive and works well across different devices.
Technical Features:

React Components: Utilize React components to create a modular UI.
Next.js Routing: Utilize Next.js routing for navigation between pages.
Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Leverage Next.js SSR capabilities to improve SEO and initial page load performance.
State Management: Use React's built-in state management or a library like Redux to manage application state.
API Integration: Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with a RESTful API .
Form Handling: Implement form validation and submission for creating and editing blog posts.
Authentication: Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, and store user information securely.
Database Integration: Store blog post data in a database (e.g., MongoDB, Firebase).
Error Handling: Implement error handling for API requests and form submissions.
Testing: Write unit tests for critical components using tools like Jest and React Testing Library.
Additional Features (Optional):

Comments: Allow users to comment on blog posts.
Search Functionality: Implement a search feature to search for blog posts.
Pagination: Implement pagination for viewing multiple blog posts.
Rich Text Editing: Use libraries like Draft.js or Slate.js for a rich text editor in the blog post creation/editing form.
